# Hypertext Store

Hypertext Store is a library of print documents, such as reports, analysis and election leaflets, liberated on the Web in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML).


## Why do you need to 'liberate' print documents?

Most people and organisations use the World Wide Web as their main communications tool for distributing documents, but many of those documents are still designed and published for print, usually as [PDFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF). 

Compared with HTML content, information published in a PDF is harder to find, use and maintain. More importantly, unless created with sufficient care PDFs can often be bad for [accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility) and rarely comply with open standards. Good, standards-compliant HTML is almost always better for use on the Web.

For example, it's hard to read PDFs on your smartphone during your daily commute. A4 print pages do not fit most smartphone screens neatly, and the resolution involved means one has to zoom in and out of the page often. It's a terrible reading experience.

## Can I request an HTML version of a document?

Yes! Send me an email, [tweet me](https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1067672846808375296) or raise a GitHub Issue on this repository. I'll need to know the document title, the publishing organisation and, where possible, a URL for the original document.
