## FOREWORD

**Foreword: Leader of the Council,**

**Councillor Hall and**

**Councillor Shahul-Hameed**

This administration was elected on a manifesto that clearly outlines our commitment to you –

the nearly 400,000 residents of Croydon.

That manifesto has been translated into our Corporate Plan for
Croydon 2018-2022, a bold set of actions to deliver more efficient,
effective and accessible services and to ensure that the people
and the place of Croydon are thriving. In that plan, we defined
how we will take a radical new approach, with residents and
locally tailored services at the heart of how we deliver.

It is clear that such a radical new approach, and the future
economic growth of our borough, both rely upon our making
more and better use of the new opportunities that digital, data
and technology provide. This new Digital Strategy is therefore a
crucial enabler of how we will deliver our Corporate Plan.

Historically, Croydon is renowned for technology and innovation,
from being home to the UK’s first international airport to being
home to more than 2000 digital businesses in the borough
today. As a council, our pioneering work on digital inclusion and
transformative technology earned national recognition as Digital
Council of the Year in 2017.

But technology and the internet continues to change the world
around us at a fast and ever-accelerating pace. Our population
is growing rapidly, at a time when central government funding
for local authorities is decreasing. We face increasing
challenges and urgency around environmental sustainability,
and we cannot afford to stand still as we work towards our
vision of becoming a digitally connected town and borough fit
for the 21st century.

We’re already on our way towards becoming a truly
sustainable city. Right now, Croydon is going through an
unprecedented period of growth and revitalisation. We’re
well underway with some £5bn of borough-wide investment
that will be completed over the next few years, transforming
Croydon into a world-class destination for the high numbers
of residents and businesses moving here.

It is vital that digital is at the heart of this regeneration. Using
technology, we must deliver tailored services and build
sustainability into the design of our built environment, to
provide you with the very best living conditions. Working with
our local tech sector, we must continue to grow our digital
economy, and make sure you can access and are equipped for
the jobs of the future. We need to push further, faster with our
use of digital approaches, data and technology, to ensure our
borough thrives through the 4th industrial revolution.

This strategy sets out how we will make the most of the
opportunities digital presents us, to:

- transform your experience as a resident by making our
    online services simpler, clearer and faster - and tailored
    to your specific needs, across our different localities
- work more openly with you as Croydon changes, engaging
    you on the decisions that affect you
- help our local tech economy to grow stronger and larger,
          creating the jobs and skilled workforce of the future, and
          making sure nobody in our borough is left behind through lack
          of digital skills or access to the internet
- make our borough and our public services smarter and more
          sustainable using innovative ideas and technologies


We and our Cabinet colleagues are pleased to endorse this new
strategy. It sets a clear path for the next 5 years, to maximise
the opportunities of digital to improve the services you use, the
places where you live and work, and how efficiently the council
functions so that it can provide the best services and best
value to residents. There’s no shortage of political will to make
Croydon a truly digital council and borough.

## INTRODUCTION

**Introduction: Jo Negrini, Chief Executive**

**and Neil Williams, Chief Digital Officer**

This strategy is about recognising the way the internet has changed our lives, and harnessing that

change to provide better outcomes for the people of Croydon.

Residents, businesses, workers, visitors and students in
Croydon rightly expect their interactions with the council and
their experience in and around our urban spaces to be as
straightforward, connected, convenient and technologically
advanced as the very best of their experiences elsewhere.
Council staff, too, have similar expectations of the tools they use
to do their jobs. And, at the organisation level, we have political
and financial imperatives to operate as efficiently as possible.

We have a remarkable opportunity to seize these opportunities.
Croydon is a naturally ambitious council, and our borough is
going through a multi-billion pound transformation.

However, delivering these new imperatives requires not just a
new set of actions, but a radically different approach, hence
this new strategy and accompanying roadmap.

It is important to recognise that digital is not a separate activity
in its own right, but an enabler of everything else the council is
doing (defined in our Corporate Plan for Croydon 2018-2022) and
of how we are doing it (due to be articulated in our upcoming
Workforce Strategy). This strategy and accompanying roadmap
exist to support the whole council’s goals, by radically re-
imagining how we design, deliver and operate our services in
the internet age, tailored for different localities.


It is essential we do this well, to stay competitive as a council
and place, and to fulfill our duty to residents, communities and
businesses by helping them survive and thrive as the world
changes rapidly around them.

We are already well underway building new capability in
the council to deliver this strategy:

- we’ve brought in new digital leadership
- we’ve signed the Local Digital Declaration, a public
    pledge along with hundreds of other councils to meet high
    standards for our technology and digital services and adopt
    digital culture and ways of working
- we are a founding member of the new London Office of
    Technology and Innovation
- we’re putting in place new techniques and capability for
    agile software delivery and user-centred design
- we’ve moved the council’s core technology services to
    new specialised providers and shorter contracts, giving us
    greater flexibility to improve the tools we rely on
- we are working more openly, blogging about our digital
    delivery for transparency and public feedback


This strategy itself was developed in the open, as a public
conversation via the croydon.digital blog. Thank you to all
who provided ideas and comments.

Digital moves fast, and digital strategy documents date faster.
Therefore while this strategy sets a high level framework for
where we’re going and how we’ll move forwards over the next
few years, the specific timings of what we do will continue
to evolve as we deliver and learn - in the open, via our public
roadmap at https://croydon.digital/roadmap

You can feedback and influence it at any time - these are your
digital services after all.

ABOUT THIS STRATEGY

Digital is not about technology,

it’s about changing the way

people live, connect and work.

```
This strategy, therefore, is about how we will deliver the
services and infrastructure our residents need in order to
thrive and live happy, healthy lives in Croydon, now and for
years to come. It’s about how we as a council can achieve
more, with less, to serve our residents better and tailor how
we deliver services to meet differing needs in our localities.
It’s about creating a modern, sustainable town and borough
that is a great place to live, work, play and do business, and
about making sure we remain resilient and competitive in a
rapidly changing world.
As a consequence of delivering this strategy:
```
- Croydon residents will have a radically better experience
    when accessing the council’s services and information, with
    an easy-to-use website that works on any device, digital
    services so good and convenient that people prefer to use
    them when they can, and digital communications which
    inform and consult them on the issues they care about
- Croydon residents will also have access to an enhanced
    digital skills offer, helping them build their confidence
    in areas from basic computer literacy through to the
    professional skills they need to access the jobs of the future
- Croydon residents, visitors, students and businesses
    will enjoy faster broadband connectivity and a digitally-
    enhanced public realm, through initiatives including public
    WiFi, digital wayfinding information, apps that bring the
    community together, and smart technology solutions that
    help reduce energy consumption, lower emissions, improve
    public safety and help make Croydon a more attractive
    place to be
       - Croydon will have a thriving digital business sector, with
          start-ups, scale-ups and established businesses creating
          growth and prosperity, working together as a cooperative
          ecosystem, and helping to change perceptions of
          Croydon as we become more widely recognised a leading
          destination for tech
       - Croydon council staff will have access to continuously
          improving technology and have the skills and confidence to
          use it well, helping them deliver great services to residents
          as efficiently as possible and freeing up more of their time
          for frontline services
       - Partner organisations will be able to work with the council
          and with each other more effectively, supported by digital
          collaboration tools and more open communications, and
          making use of shared data and digital platforms to enable a
          more joined-up, system-wide approach to delivering positive
          change in Croydon

##### About this strategy

“A truly digital council will be more

connected and integrated, using digital

to reimagine service delivery that is user-

centric and meets users’ needs - with

citizens, communities and businesses

reaping the benefits.”

Council of the Future: A digital guide for councillors -
Tech UK 2018.


ABOUT THIS STRATEGY

**Definition of digital**

When we say digital in this strategy, we mean the following
definition, widely adopted in the UK public sector:

“Applying the culture, processes, business

models and technologies of the internet era to

respond to people’s raised expectations”

Tom Loosemore, Public Digital

**Policy context**

This digital strategy is an enabling document to the council’s
Corporate Plan for Croydon 2018-2022. Having a responsive,
agile and user-centred digital service is key to the successful
delivery of the council’s ambitions.

Six themes are discussed in the Corporate Plan which
represent the council’s way of operating in the future. Digital
contributes meaningfully to each:

- Evidence is key
- Preventing issues becoming problems
- Locality matters
- Residents drive what we do

```
We will put residents at the heart of our approach to designing digital services,
using research and continual testing to ensure our services meet their real-
world needs, enabling them to achieve their goals as quickly and efficiently
as possible. As we transform our digital services we will also create rapid,
often real-time feedback loops, enabling services and underlying policy to
be continuously improved based on evidence of how well they are meeting
residents’ needs.
Data science and new data analytics platforms enable evidence from multiple
sources to be combined and interpreted in new ways, for better (sometimes
automated and predictive) decision making. The council is already making good
use of these new capabilities, developing dashboards to provide rich insights,
and has plans to embed a culture of business intelligence to support our
localities model.
Thirdly, through better use of digital engagement tools and social media, we can
increase the scale and openness with which we engage residents in decisions
that affect them.
```
- A system wide approach
    Digital enables collaboration across organisations and sectors to achieve shared
    outcomes, and collaboration is one of our main themes of this digital strategy.
- Organisation design

```
Every part of the council workforce relies upon effective digital tools, and stands
to benefit from the adoption of digital culture and ways of working in order to
become a more adaptive, connected, mobile and collaborative organisation.
```

VISON

Our vision is to become a truly digital council

and borough.

We will harness the potential of digital design, data and technology to work efficiently, transform
the relationship between residents and the council, and make Croydon a leading destination for
growth, opportunity and quality of life.

We will do this by focusing on three main themes (supported by a fourth):

**1. Digital council**

We will optimise how the council uses digital design, data and technology to work efficiently,
collaborate, make informed decisions, adapt and innovate.

**2. Digital services**

We will transform the relationship between residents and the council by providing online services so
good that most people choose to use them and can do so unaided.

**3. Digital borough**

We will maximise opportunities for digital design, data and technology to enhance economic growth,
quality of life, sustainability and individual opportunity in Croydon.

Success in all of these three main themes above will be unlocked and accelerated by progress
in a fourth, cross-cutting theme:

**4. Collaboration and data**

We will use digital tools to collaborate with organisations across all sectors, make Croydon’s data
open and share digital assets for the public good.

##### Vision

```
By delivering against all these themes we will become digital inside and out,
maximising the opportunities for our council and borough in partnership with
organisations across the system.

PRINCIPLES AND APPROACH TO DELIVERY

##### Principles and approach to delivery

Our strategy is underpinned by the following principles, which guide

the way we work as we pursue our vision.

**1. We focus relentlessly on meeting user needs**

As a digital service, we exist to meet the needs of our users
(from residents to internal colleagues). Every piece of work
we undertake will be based upon meeting a need that our
service users have, which will help us to always build the
right thing. We do this by speaking directly to our users and
observing how they interact with our services, focusing on
what they show they need rather than say they want.

We make sure our digital services are accessible to all
users, regardless of disability.

We are acutely aware of the digitally excluded, and so we
make sure:

- **assisted digital** support is available to help residents use
    our digital services
- **digital inclusion** learning opportunities and public
    computers are available across the borough, to help
    more residents get online
- non-digital channels always remain available to those
    who really need them
       **2. We support and continuously improve all our**
       **products and services**
       We only implement technology solutions we are confident
       we can sustainably operate, support and continuously
       improve. We adopt a “shift left” approach to our operational
       support, continuously improving our ability to solve users’
       problems and requests on first contact.
       No service is ever finished, or complete. There are always
       improvements that can be made. We will embed this
       concept into our work as much as our resources allow,
       putting working products into the hands of users early so we
       can test how well they work, providing us with the insight
       needed to improve them over time. We won’t be afraid to
       experiment and fail, delete things that don’t work, learn from
       them and try new approaches.
       **3. We base our decisions on evidence**
       We will base all of our design and technology decisions on
       the basis of the insight gained through activities such as
       user research, service performance metrics, the study of
       web analytics, user feedback and other available evidence,
       rather than relying on guesswork. We have an enormous
       amount to do, so will prioritise rigorously based on evidence
       of what will deliver the best outcomes for users. We will
       ensure that we monitor the performance of live services and
       use that data to identify where we need to improve them.
          **4. We invest in teams, not projects**
          Our aim to become a truly digital council and borough
          is predicated on investing in the people and technology
          needed to effect this significant change. Digital work is often
          packaged into programmes of work, with defined, time-
          limited budgets, and teams that disband once the project is
          ‘complete’. But we know that digital products and services
          are never complete, and must be continually improved and
          iterated upon. We therefore intend digital work to become
          a mainstream activity, to develop the council into an
          organisation that is digital rather than just does digital.
          **5. We work in the open**
          Our aim is to work as openly as we can on all of our projects.
          This means we blog about our work and what we are
          learning, and we share our ideas widely to get feedback and
          suggestions. Where we can we will share code, learnings
          and other products we create, enabling others to benefit
          from our efforts. We also share our data, safely putting it out
          there to help others create value from it. This helps us to do
          better work, as it creates a much bigger community around
          what we are doing than just an internal audience.


##### THEME 1: Digital council

**Our desired outcomes:**

- All council staff have fit for purpose corporate technology and line of business systems which facilitate rather than
    constrain their work, which work well together, are resilient and can be changed rapidly to meet their users’ changing
    needs
- All council staff make effective use of cloud collaboration and productivity software to communicate, safely share and
    store information, and work with increasing efficiency
- All council staff can work effectively from anywhere, including fast and reliable network and telephony access in all
    council-owned buildings across the borough, and suitable assistive technology for staff who need it
- All technology-related projects in the council provide value for money, have clearly defined outcomes, meet quality
    and cybersecurity standards, and are managed well
- The council has a full understanding of its total expenditure on digital, data and technology and the return on this
    investment, and is reducing this total over time
- All council staff are confident in their wider digital skills and understanding, including agile delivery methods, user-
    centric service design, data literacy and GDPR, cybersecurity, online engagement and working in the open
- All council staff can and do access data intelligence and have the knowledge, support and skills to manage and use
    data legally and ethically, to measure service performance, predict and anticipate demand, and make well-informed
    decisions
- The council’s political and executive leadership exemplify and champion digital expertise and culture including user-
    centred design, agile methods and working in the open
- All council staff can find internal guidance and information quickly and easily on the council’s intranet, and are
    digitally engaged in leadership decisions

“Digital is something you are, not something you

do. It’s about how you think, how you behave,

what you value, and what drives decisions in

your organisation.”

technology to work efficiently,

collaborate, make informed

decisions, adapt and innovate.

THEME 1: DIGITAL COUNCIL


**Where we are now**

As set out in the ICT Sourcing Strategy paper to Cabinet in November 2017, we have made significant progress in recent
years to equip council staff and members with flexible, modern equipment and software, while delivering multi-million
pound savings and mitigating cybersecurity risks. We can be proud that we have some of the best IT of any council.

Our ambitious ICT transformation programme proposed in that same paper is now nearing completion, and has successfully
delivered a more flexible, multi-vendor technology ecosystem for the council’s core, corporate technology. This forward-
thinking transformation is the bedrock for all our future digital ambitions, meets principle 2 of the Local Digital Declaration
(“fix the plumbing”), and is regarded as an exemplar by many of our local government peers. The council now has more
control over quality of service for all technology we currently use and the ability to respond more rapidly to changes.

Across the council, we also make use of hundreds of line of business systems which enable our organisation to function
and our workforce to deliver public services. We have powerful tools at our disposal for data intelligence and reporting, an
emerging Business Intelligence Strategy, a number of dashboards and a growing capability in developing and using them to
manage performance metrics, predict issues and inform policy decisions.

However, current expenditure on digital, data and technology initiatives is spread across departments, making it
challenging to get a true total cost of investment. The quality of our delivery is variable, and there is considerable
duplication and inefficiency as well as usability challenges across our software estate. Like all councils, we have a
sprawling portfolio of legacy applications and databases, built in a pre-digital era and often unfit to support modern online
services. We also continue to operate a high number of paper-based and manual processes, and there is significant
potential for the council to achieve savings, higher staff satisfaction and provide better services for residents from
digitising more of our internal operations.

Going forward, we need to improve capability across the council to make the best use of the equipment and software we
already have. We need to improve governance and visibility over IT spend in delegated budget lines, establishing stronger
controls to ensure value for money and standards assurance. We need a clear architectural vision that will enable us to
reduce the complexity and size of our back-office software estate and reduce duplication over time, and to increase use
of Software as a Service models so that we only pay for what we need. Where practical, we need to begin using service
design methods for our back office systems, to improve usability for council staff, and adopt a more agile, digital culture
across the organisation that places user needs at the heart of how we choose, buy, build and implement technology in the
council and how we design our internal processes.

THEME 1: DIGITAL COUNCIL


(^) **THEME 1: Digital council continued...
What we will do
To move forward in this area, we will:**

**1.** Develop a clear architectural vision for all council
    technology systems, working towards an irreducible
    core of specialist applications and shared components
    that provide common functions once, integrated through
    APIs, using cloud and Software as a Service solutions
    wherever possible
**2.** Put in place a new, robust governance framework to ensure
    all changes to technology across the council are fit-for-
    purpose, cost-effective, secure, in line with the architectural
    vision and meet the government’s Technology Code of
    Practice and Service Standard; and to get clarity on the
    council’s total spend on technology
**3.** Re-tender our (recently disaggregated) corporate ICT
    contracts every few years to ensure best value and service,
    and diversify our supplier base including buying local where
    possible to do so
**4.** Create permanent capability for transforming major line
    of business systems, recognising that this is a continuous
    activity, and work with peers in other councils to positively
    disrupt the marketplace for these systems
**5.** Conclude the development of our Business Intelligence
    Strategy and implementation plan to further our use of data-
    led intelligence across the council, with a particular focus
    on supporting localities-based service delivery
**6.** Design and run a mandatory learning and development
    programme and provide ongoing learning opportunities for
    all staff to increase digital confidence, instill cybersecurity
    best practices, improve data literacy, awareness and
    stewardship, and embed a more digital culture including
    agile methods and working in the open
       **7.** Develop digital leadership capability within the council,
          in line with the Local Digital Declaration, prioritising
          the corporate leadership team (the top 3 tiers of council
          officers) and Cabinet members
       **8.** Implement a best-of-breed contact centre and enterprise
          telephony system, ensuring residents can contact and hear
          from the council reliably and consistently
       **9.** Review and improve how we support and train users of
          corporate and line-of-business software to maximise their
          effective use, including introducing agile and user centred
          service design methodologies to optimise the usability of
          our software
       **10.** Seek out opportunities to use new and emerging
          technologies such as robotic process automation and
          machine learning to automate low value tasks and improve
          operational efficiency, freeing up officer time for frontline
          services to residents
       **11.** Review current processes for providing assistive
          technology for staff with disabilities, ensuring we make the
          best use of available technology to support all our staff
       **12.** Support the council’s communications team to transform
          the corporate intranet and provide improved tools for
          internal digital engagement and information-sharing
       **13.** Deliver an ongoing portfolio of improvements to council
          systems, corporate ICT and automation of sub-optimal or
          paper-based council processes, prioritised on our public
          roadmap

THEME 1: DIGITAL COUNCIL

**Indicative dates**

**for priority deliverables**

- New governance processes are in place now (July 2019)
    and will begin to create savings within this financial year
    and in subsequent years by preventing unnecessary or
    wasteful spend on technology, while driving up quality
    and usability for internal users and residents
- Digital leadership development has begun and will
    continue with digital-themed learning and development
    days for 30 of the most senior leaders in the council
    in July and again in autumn 2019. An internal learning
    programme for all council staff will be in place by
    December 2019, with the aim that all staff complete
    mandatory elements by July 2020
- A programme is underway to replace major internal
    systems used for adults and children's social care,
    expected to complete by October 2020, delivering
    improvements to the quality and efficiency of vital
    social care services
- We will complete transformation of the council’s
    telephony systems by March 2020

THEME 1: DIGITAL COUNCIL

“I would like to see digital technology used to

facilitate open fair and transparent procurement

at Croydon Council”

“It would be a great idea to do digital training for

staff working in Access Croydon so that they can help

residents quicker. Many come in because they do not

know how to do certain things on the website and it

would be better if we are trained properly.”

“Embrace a culture of agility and acceptable risk taking,

find out enough to move forward, write down what

needs to be written down, review and learn regularly,

without requiring slavish adherence to a methodology”

**Comments from Croydon residents and council staff as part of the online conversation
and internal survey that helped shape this strategy**


##### THEME 2: Digital services

**THEME 2: DIGITAL SERVICES**

**Our desired outcomes:**

- All council services that could be made available online, are available online, with digital as the default service
    supported by an “assisted digital” offer and alternative channels still available for those who need more help
- Most users choose to use digital services over alternatives, so that the vast majority of interactions between residents
    and the council (75% or higher, excluding planned casework) take the form of online self-service
- Of people using the council’s online services, the vast majority (75% or higher) can complete them successfully,
    unaided, first time, and rate them good or excellent
- Information about the council’s democratic process, decisions, delivery and policies are easy to find, understand and
    (where appropriate) influence through online platforms
- Residents who want to do so are able to receive relevant notifications from the council about issues and opportunities
    of interest to them, from the status of services they rely on through to policy and planning decisions
- The council’s website and digital services are built with re-use in mind, so that our information and services can easily
    be found through search engines, and are accessible using 3rd party devices such as voice assistants
- All council information is in open, accessible formats by default, removing any barriers to access for people with
    disabilities, and enabling online sharing and preservation
- All online council services and official information have a consistent user experience, sharing a single design system
    and interaction patterns

“This is not about polishing websites and

making online copies of existing, paper-

based transactions - broken services

delivered onto a computer screen. It’s

about a new, better approach to the design,

operation and consumption of its services,

focused on citizens and outcomes.”

Digitising Government - Alan Brown, Jerry Fishenden
and Mark Thompson 2014

We will transform the relationship

between residents and the council

by providing online services so

good that most people choose to

use them and can do so unaided.


THEME 2: DIGITAL SERVICES

**Where we are now**

We have made visible and impactful inroads into digitising our services in recent years, through our Customer Access and
Digital and Enabling transformation projects.

As a result, there are around 180,000 registered users of the council’s “My Account” system, which enables access to
more than 100 services online 24/7, including waste collection, housing services, council tax and appointment booking.
This has reduced face-to-face demand in Access Croydon, cut waiting times and increased communication with residents,
delivering savings of over £10m per annum. Our website is heavily used with 140,00 visitors per month looking for guidance
and information. Our mobile app, “Don’t Mess with Croydon” has been downloaded over 3,600 times and enables residents to
report fly-tipping, potholes and other issues with our public spaces.

These achievements notwithstanding, there is considerable potential to improve the quality and further reduce the cost of
services to residents by providing more of them online, and by applying the user-centric design methods used by the private
sector and central government to ensure that more people can use them successfully. Currently, around 30% of all contact
between residents and the council takes place via online self-service. We want and need this to be much higher, making all
council services digital by default, while also ensuring that we always cater for the digitally excluded.

Recent analysis has found that usage of My Account has begun to decline and a quarter of all website visits result in users
contacting the council for help, suggesting their needs are not being fully met online. Our web estate has inconsistent design,
has been rated poorly in some external reviews, and in places fails to comply with new, higher standards of accessibility.
There is clear demand from residents for more convenient, truly accessible and higher quality digital services they can
access 24/7, and more open and transparent information and engagement through digital channels.

Recognising the need for continuous and rapid improvement of our digital services, the council has recently invested in new
capability, forming the Croydon Digital Service - a new directorate in the council that is already bringing about a step change
in the council’s approach to delivering user-centric services for residents. We have signed the Local Digital Declaration,
a public pledge to deliver digital services in accordance with the methods set out in the Government Service Manual and
to ensure all new and updated services going forwards meet the high quality standards set out in the Government Service
Standard. CDS is working in close partnership with the Residents First Programme, to ensure we understand our residents
and customers so that we can listen and respond and work together to improve our front line services.

THEME 2: DIGITAL SERVICES

(^) **THEME 2: Digital services continued...
What we will do
To move forward in this area, we will:**

**1.** Transform the council’s website, introducing a consistent,
    mobile-first design system across all official sites and
    digital services, applying the user-centric design methods
    as set out in the Government Service Manual to ensure it
    meets residents’ needs
**2.** Overhaul our processes and standards for creating and
    maintaining content, ensuring all guidance is succinct,
    clearly understandable by users and reliably up to date so
    that residents trust the website as the canonical source for
    official information
**3.** Review the technology underpinning our digital services, to
    ensure we have a resilient, supported and fit-for-purpose
    set of platforms that in combination enable us to rapidly
    and sustainably build, maintain, and continuously improve
    digital services to better meet the needs of our users
**4.** Review and tighten up our criteria for permitting the
    creation of separate websites, with the aim of significantly
    decreasing the number of microsites and subdomains the
    council operates
**5.** ransform how we deliver digital services, working T
    in multidisciplinary agile delivery teams capable of
    redesigning services from end to end, ensuring that a
    user’s needs are considered and met throughout the whole
    process, and that back office systems and processes are
    integrated with front end delivery
**6.** Introduce robust assurance processes to ensure all digital
    services developed by the council or its suppliers are of
    high quality, meeting the Government Service Standard
       **7.** Redevelop the Explore Croydon website as a more effective
          ‘digital induction’ for new residents, a promotional tool for
          visitors and prospective residents, and a definitive local
          guide for existing residents, working collaboratively with
          other interested parties
       **8.** Review and improve our online engagement with residents,
          including formal online consultation, the council’s
          email newsletters and push notifications, and informal
          engagement and customer support through social media,
          working with the communications and customer contact
          departments
       **9.** Continue to blog about our work on croydon.digital and
          encourage other service areas to do the same on a new
          corporate blogging platform, supporting them with the skills
          and technology to more openly communicate about the
          work of the council
       **10.** Ensure that there is a sufficient “assisted digital” support
          for residents who cannot use council services online,
          through the contact centre and face-to-face touchpoints
          including Access Croydon, library services and the
          emerging localities delivery model
       **11.** Investigate and experiment with emerging technology
          where there is an opportunity to better meet our users’
          needs, including live chat, chatbots and voice operated
          services
       **12.** Deliver an ongoing portfolio of improvements to existing
          online services and the creation of new digital services,
          prioritised on our public roadmap

**Indicative dates**

**for priority deliverables**

- We aim to deliver an ‘alpha’ (prototype) version of new
    website by August 2019, for testing with residents and
    stakeholders. A public ‘beta’ version will follow by
    November 2019, and begin replacing popular parts of
    the current site. The new site will become the default
    from March 2020, with ongoing work to replace all
    remaining parts of the old site through 2020/
- To support this work, we aim to have a new, flexible
    digital services development platform in place by
    January 2020 so we can digitise and improve more of
    the council’s transactional services for residents
- All new and redeveloped digital services will be
    assessed against the Government’s Service Standard
    from July 2019 onwards, and the outcomes of these
    assessments will be published on croydon.digital
- Improvements to the council’s online engagement with
    residents will begin to be visible from October 2019, with
    a full review of social media usage to follow in 2020

THEME 2: DIGITAL SERVICES

“Services to do with council tax updates, claiming benefits

and anything to do with residents need to be automated.

Residents usually get delayed responses as everything

is done manually [...] Automation will result in happier

residents and less call traffic as well as less visits to

Access Croydon for minor issues. Many residents are

frustrated, please sort it out.”

“The Croydon website is not easy to use. Hard to find

things. Make the website clear.”

“Make online forms easy to understand. They should be

faster to complete as people have things to do!”

**Comments from Croydon residents and council staff as part of the online conversation
and internal survey that helped shape this strategy**


##### THEME 3: Digital borough

**THEME 3: DIGITAL BOROUGH**

**Our desired outcomes:**

- Croydon has a thriving digital business sector and community, with a mixed ecosystem of startups, small to medium
    sized enterprises and large technology companies moving to and growing in the borough
- Croydon has outstanding digital infrastructure, including ultrafast internet and mobile network connectivity, able to
    support the ambitions of our residents, businesses, community and voluntary sector, and public services
- Croydon has a digitally-confident population, able to make the most of opportunities that being active on the internet
    brings, should they choose to do so, reducing social exclusion
- Croydon residents have the skills to access the jobs of the future, and employers have access to a pipeline of local
    talent for digital, data and technology careers
- Croydon’s digital and tech workforce indexes higher than the national average for BAME (Black, Asian and minority
    ethnic) and female employees, reflecting our diverse borough
- Croydon’s community and voluntary sector is digitally mature, able to adopt the culture, processes, business models
    and technologies of the internet era to fulfill their mission
- Croydon is using a range of innovative data and technology driven solutions to create a sustainable and more efficient
    borough, with a growing reputation as a leading destination for innovation in Smart Cities, GovTech and UrbanTech

“We need to be bold and to think big. This

involves being willing to try new ways of doing

things. I see London’s future as a global ‘test-

bed city’ for civic innovation, where the best

ideas are developed, amplified and scaled.”

Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan,
Smarter London Together plan, July 2018

We will maximise opportunities for

digital design, data and technology

to enhance growth, quality of

life, sustainability and individual

opportunity in Croydon.


THEME 3: DIGITAL BOROUGH

**Where we are now**

Croydon has a strong reputation as a fast-growing digital
ecosystem, a pioneer in digital inclusion initiatives and an
early adopter of innovative technology.

We’re incredibly proud of our thriving tech sector, which
has grown by 41% in the past 5 years to over 2,000
businesses and nearly 8,000 jobs, and of our desirable
conditions for tech startups and scale-ups including co-
working spaces such as TMRW and the Sussex Innovation
Centre. We owe much to Croydon Tech City, the voluntary
organisation that promoted Croydon as the “Silicon Valley
of South London” between 2012 and 2018, and we have
recently launched Croydon Digital to continue to convene,
promote and grow our tech economy.

On digital skills, in recent years we have supported digital
inclusion initiatives through the Our Community fund, and
partnered with Doteveryone to bring 3rd parties and the
community together to change people’s lives through
digital skills and access. CALAT provides adult courses in
digital skills, and the council itself provides apprenticeship
opportunities in digital and technology roles.

In the Smart City Programme paper to Cabinet in December
2017 we set out our ambition to become a world-class digital
and smart city, with a forward plan of activities in partnership
with private sector and community. Since then, we’ve made
significant progress on all themes of the paper, with a wide
variety of initiatives both underway and in development.

```
However, there is room for improvement across all these
areas, and enormous potential to change perceptions of
Croydon and ensure our people and businesses thrive in the
internet era.
```
```
We need to do more to promote Croydon as a destination
for tech businesses, and rebuild momentum and grow the
ambition for tech community events. Digital skills work has
```
```
tailed off and should be brought back to the fore to ensure
no resident is left behind as a consequence of low digital
literacy, and to ensure people of all ages have access to the
jobs of the future. Our Smart Cities work is still nascent, and
now needs to come together as a mainstream activity in our
digital roadmap, aligned to the Smarter London Together
and sub-regional plans, with a particular focus on improving
broadband connectivity speeds across the borough.
```
**Smart City initiatives completed since December 2017**

- **Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure:** 4 LoRaWAN gateways now in place across the borough
- **Air Quality Monitoring around construction sites:** 3 month pilot completed and we are now exploring extending the pilot
    to cover all 20-26 regeneration construction sites
- **Humidity and temperature monitoring on a social housing block:** pilot underway on a housing unit undergoing recladding
    works to measure the impact of black mould, and build the business case for wider deployment
- **Broadband connectivity:** full fibre rollout for social housing underway across the borough. Mobilisation is planned from
    June 2019 onwards and is due to take 2-5 years
- **CCTV upgrade:** feasibility study completed and business case under development
- **Pothole detection:** pilot completed using connected vehicles and machine learning for early detection of defects and
    damage on road surfaces
- **Smart parking pilot:** 12 month pilot underway since April 2019 to trial a fully automated parking payment system, which
    uses number plate recognition cameras to detect when drivers enter and leave a car park, and bill drivers accurately
- **Sustainable mobility:** installation of new electric vehicle charging points across the borough in progress, with a
    corporate commitment to having 400 public charging points by 2022


THEME 3: DIGITAL BOROUGH

(^) **THEME 3: Digital borough continued...
What we will do
To move forward in this area, we will:**

**1.** Take a proactive role in convening, facilitating and
    promoting Croydon’s digital, data and technology community
    under the brand Croydon Digital, further developing the
    brand, events programme and website to support business-
    to-business connections, recruitment, careers advice
    and skills, resources for non-digital businesses, and to
    encourage inward investment
**2.** Form a Croydon Digital Board with representation
    from Croydon’s tech community and wider experts to
    collaboratively develop plans to grow Croydon Digital,
    with ambitions to establish Croydon as a leader in Smart
    Cities, GovTech and UrbanTech and launch an annual
    digital festival
**3.** Seek out and exploit opportunities to strengthen and expand
    the availability of tech co-working spaces, incubators, co-
    ops and accelerators in the town and other district centres
**4.** Work with the education sector and other partner
    organisations to boost the number of people with the
    skills needed to contribute to our local digital economy,
    by improving the tech skills offer for people of all ages at
    existing institutions, and creating a new offer working with
    schools, FE and HE institutions to provide a wide range of
    learning opportunities for all ages, from code clubs through
    to university courses. Tech will form a core part of the
    Croydon Creative Campus
       **5.** ake a research-based approach to identify the skills T
          needed by our local digital businesses and the best means
          of developing them, including working with local businesses
          to create more apprenticeships and work experience
          opportunities in digital careers. (Within the council, we
          will provide 3-5 apprenticeships and 2-3 internships
          in digital roles on a rolling basis, and additional digital
          apprenticeships through our supply chain)
       **6.** Deliver our already published action plan for connectivity
          in Croydon, working with providers of fixed, wireless and
          mobile solutions in a holistic manner to deliver ultrafast
          broadband to all homes (prioritising social housing) and
          businesses, public WiFi where it is needed most, and
          prepare Croydon for the future with 5G and small cell
          networks
       **7.** Launch a Croydon Digital Challenge, to identify and seed-
          fund innovative solutions to local civic problems, starting
          with 2 challenges in 2019/20 with a view to repeating and
          growing the approach if it delivers value both for the council
          and participants
       **8.** Continue to take forward Smart City pilots using our Internet
          of Things network and advances in sensor technology
          and artificial intelligence to better manage public assets
          and improve sustainability in public services, with the aim
          of converting at least 1 successful pilot into a full-scale
          solution each year, starting in 2019/20
       **9.** ake forward pilots to improve the public realm through T
          Smart City solutions, looking at innovation such as smart
          pavements, smart parking, smart benches, electric vehicle
          charging points, digital signage and interactive experiences
             **10.** Optimise digital advertising across the borough to leverage
                council-owned street furniture for improving street safety,
                monitoring air quality, footfall and other non-personal data,
                and explore the provision of free WiFi, wayfinding and local
                information
             **11.** Actively work with property developers to encourage
                uptake of Smart City solutions in the built environment, and
                explore the potential to develop a digital and Smart City
                infrastructure standard for all new property development
             **12.** ake forward the CCTV digitisation programme to enhance T
                safety in Croydon including implementation of on-street
                cameras, an enhanced control room and connectivity
             **13.** Undertake a review of our current digital inclusion offer
                to inform a new approach to providing residents with the
                confidence and access to use the internet, and to improve
                social inclusion
             **14.** Promote and develop our offer for the innovative use
                of assistive technology in enabling residents to remain
                healthy, safe and independent, including helping those with
                care needs to stay longer in their own homes
             **15.** Explore opportunities to support and promote the use
                of community-focused platforms to enhance the local
                economy, encourage ‘buying local’ and create social value,
                for example activities, business and volunteering listings,
                b2b collaboration apps and a local currency
             **16.** Deliver an ongoing portfolio of smaller Smart City, digital
                economy and digital skills initiatives, prioritised on our
                public roadmap


THEME 3: DIGITAL BOROUGH

**Indicative dates**

**for priority deliverables**

```
Rollout of fibre broadband to all social housing in the
borough will begin mobilisation in November 2019, and
take 2-4 years to complete. As well as providing fibre to
social housing tenants this will create infrastructure to
accelerate fibre rollout to other areas
```

“It is hard to recruit good local technical people. But I believe that the

transformation that Croydon is going through could generate the assets

required to get there. It must start with schools preparing kids to the jobs of

today and of the future. Croydon is massive and should host an International

level University with degrees such as finance, marketing, and engineering of

all kinds, including computer science.”

“It would be better to have more WiFi spots to video call people

so that you have a backup if you run out of data.”

“Croydon needs to plan for connected street furniture, smart parking, wireless

mesh networks, the changing nature of public and private interfaces (e.g.

in-car voice assistants) and what 5G will bring. [...] The technologies exist

for Croydon to do something ground-breaking. It’d be great to see Croydon

pioneering their use”

```

##### THEME 4: Collaboration and data

**THEME 4: COLLABORATION AND DATA**

**Our desired outcomes:**

- Appropriate digital channels are in place to facilitate the council, other public services, business and the community
    and voluntary sector to share information and collaborate effectively
- There is a culture of collaboration and reuse of digital assets and data between all organisations delivering public
    good in Croydon, minimising duplication of effort and accelerating our collective capability to deliver better outcomes
    for our communities
- All organisations in Croydon can contribute to and access a growing set of shared data stores and common platforms
    that they can make use of to create and enhance digital products and services
- The council plays an active role in local and national digital communities of practice, sharing our experience and
    capabilities, and is a recognised leader in digital

“Working together in partnership to create one

shared purpose and one shared vision, we will

work with the voluntary sector, public services,

business community and community groups to

deliver our outcomes”

Tony Newman, Leader of the Council, Corporate Plan 2018-22

We will use digital tools to

collaborate with organisations

across all sectors, make Croydon’s

data open and share digital assets

for the public good.


THEME 4: COLLABORATION AND DATA

**Where we are now**

The council has existing partnerships and alliances with
a number of organisations, most notably the One Croydon
Alliance - a partnership of 6 bodies collaborating across
organisational boundaries for better health and wellbeing
outcomes - and we work closely with statutory agencies
and the community and voluntary sector across a range
of other deliverables outlined in our Corporate Plan. There
is considerable potential to make better use of technology
to facilitate information-sharing across these existing
partnerships, and help us forge new ones.

An effective system-wide approach also relies on shared
local data. A wide range of data about Croydon, and
transparency information about council operations, is already
publicly available via the Croydon Observatory, our corporate
website, the London Data store and data.gov.uk. However,
there is more to do to unlock more data, improve quality,
make all our data easier to find and ensure it conforms to
open standards. Of particular priority is the geographic
data held by the council, which is currently split across
disparate systems and needs work and clearer ownership
to get it where it needs to be and make it available for reuse.
However, we are in a strong position to radically improve how
the council uses, combines and shares data from multiple
sources, having invested in a fit-for-purpose cloud business
intelligence platform. For example, we have recently begun
scoping work on data intelligence to help us take targeted
action across the system to prevent violent crime.

As the council reviews and refreshes its core digital
platforms and rationalises its portfolio of back office
software, there is an opportunity to create common platforms
and codebases that are shared not only within the council,
but with partners across the system as “public good” civic
assets. A small example of such a platform exists already in

```
the form of Croydon Digital (www.croydon.digital) - a shared
publishing platform for the tech and digital community. The
council has a number of open source capabilities that can be
enabled for reuse across the local system, and we expect that
other organisations are similarly creating digital assets with
untapped potential for reuse. We want to explore the potential
to share these actively across the local system.
Similarly, it is imperative that we reuse and share ideas,
technology and approaches across both central and local
government. As one of London’s largest boroughs, Croydon has
a major role to play in contributing to joined-up solutions for
```
```
the whole city, and co-delivering the Smarter London Together
plan. Our status as one of the founding members of the new
London Office for Technology and Innovation stands us in good
stead to collaborate closely with other London boroughs.
Nationally, local authorities have similar problems to solve
and increasingly limited resources, and so wherever possible
we will both contribute to and make use of common solutions,
shared platforms and lessons learned with all our local
government peers. We have committed to do so by signing
the Local Digital Declaration, and are active participants in
networks of our digital peers such as LocalGovDigital.
```

THEME 4: COLLABORATION AND DATA

(^) **THEME 4: Collaboration and data continued...
What we will do
To move forward in this area, we will:**

**1.** Publish data openly wherever possible, in reusable formats,
    and work with partners to identify the most appropriate
    channels to use to do this
**2.** Put in place the necessary technology and governance to
    allow for easy appropriate data sharing across the borough
**3.** Develop and steward a digital platform of reusable
    technology components, to be shared with partners within
    the borough
**4.** Explore the potential for a shared Croydon authentication
    capability between the council and other organisations -
    providing a trusted, secure way to prove identity online and
    enabling users to access a wide range of local services
    with a single login
**5.** Where we have a need to acquire a new technology
    solution, we will seek to reuse existing shared capabilities,
    contributing back any improvements we make
**6.** Work closely with existing collaborative partnerships, such
    as the One Croydon Alliance, to ensure user-centred digital
    products and services are delivered across organisational
    boundaries
**7.** Combine a growing capability in data science and business
    intelligence with experiments and innovations in emerging
    technologies such as machine learning and artificial
    intelligence to enable the council to predict demand and
    prevent it occurring
       **8.** Improve the council’s strategic offer and delivery of
          geographic data for internal and external use, starting with
          establishing clear ownership, roles and responsibilities
          across our currently disparate systems and data sources
       **9.** Through our status as signatories to the Local Digital
          Declaration, we will work to become an exemplar digital
          council and acknowledged as a leader in the sector in this
          area of work, liaising closely with the Ministry for Housing,
          Communities and Local Government
       **10.** Be deeply involved in digital networks within our sector
          and beyond, including being founding and active members
          of the London Office of Technology and Innovation (LOTI),
          and contributors to LocalGovDigital
       **11.** Deliver an ongoing portfolio of improvements to existing,
          and the creation of new, data and collaboration initiatives,
          prioritised on our public roadmap

**Indicative dates**

**for priority deliverables**

- We are already sharing our digital work and learning
    via croydon.digital and will continue to do this actively
- We will begin using the Local Government Digital
    Pipeline by September 2019, to share our plans and
    identify opportunities to collaborate with other local
    authorities, and contribute the findings of our user
    research to the shared library developed by Hackney
    council to benefit other councils
- We will complete a discovery project by March 2020
    on the concept of a shared digital component library
    for Croydon, and develop our plans to take this forward

THEME 4: COLLABORATION AND DATA

“Insist on data generated by infrastructure in Croydon is open by default, with

stable identifiers. Also, provide sample procurement contracts that are open and

flexible, for use in Croydon and other local government. Build a basic digital layer

into all projects – eg Westfield”

“The council has a limited budget to spend on tech improvements.[...] There

are already people in the borough that work in software, so why not leverage

them? If you open sourced some parts of the software you use, residents could

contribute and improve the software itself, saving you money and also giving

residents ownership.”

“Success for your digital strategy is about more than delivering the same

processes in a new way. Digital transformation means providing a seamless

experience to citizens meeting all their needs, predicting and preventing

problems and putting the analytics in the hands of decision-makers to drive

policy. Data and location are at the heart of this.”

##### Measuring progress

```
% of total demand met
through digital self-service
```
```
This stands at approximately 30% at present and we aim to increase this
year on year, towards the ambition set in this paper of 75% or higher.
This is a measure not just of our success in improving the quality of
the council’s website and online services, but also in improving digital
inclusion and connectivity across the borough so that more residents are
able to use digital services, and in transforming our internal technology
and processes to remove removing barriers to user-centric service design.
```
```
% of staff completing digital
confidence training
```
```
This stands at 0% at present and we aim to reach 100% of existing and
new staff.
```
Progress against this strategy overall will be tracked through existing corporate measurement

frameworks. At a high level, we will report regularly on the following two metrics:

Specific deliverables which move us towards the commitments set out in this strategy are detailed on our
roadmap at **croydon.digital/roadmap** , using the format of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). This means each
piece of work we undertake will have its own clearly defined objective and between 3 and 5 specific measures
of success.

In addition, we routinely track and report on a set of internal Key Performance Indicators including service
levels, take-up and user satisfaction for existing products and services.
