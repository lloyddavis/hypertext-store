**Summary**

1. The UK and EU have agreed a good deal for citizens. ​If approved by
    Parliament, the final Withdrawal Agreement will ensure our smooth and
    orderly departure from the EU on 29 March next year, including securing the
    rights of over three million EU citizens in the UK and around one million UK
    nationals in the EU, so they can carry on living their lives as before.
2. We have been clear that our first priority in negotiations has been to protect
    the rights of EU citizens living in the UK and of UK nationals living in the EU.
    We have reached an agreement with the EU that delivers on this commitment.
    The Government is clear that the reciprocal deal with the EU, as set out in the
    Withdrawal Agreement, is the only way to protect the rights of both UK
    nationals in the EU and EU citizens in the UK. The Withdrawal Agreement
    gives these citizens certainty that they can go on living their lives broadly as
    now. ​However, it is our duty as a responsible government to prepare for all
    eventualities, including ‘no deal’.
3. The UK is already taking steps to implement the agreement reached. The
    Home Office published the details of the EU Settlement Scheme in a
    Statement of Intent on 21 June 2018, and has opened the scheme on a live
    trial basis. The scheme will be opened fully by 30 March next year. We will
    continue working closely with our EU partners to understand how they will
    uphold their commitments to protect the rights of UK nationals in the EU​.
4. To remove any ambiguity about their future, the UK Government wants to
    reassure EU citizens and their family members living in the UK that they are
    welcome to stay in the UK in the unlikely event of a ‘no deal’ scenario. ​The
    Government is adopting an approach based on the Withdrawal Agreement.
    We have been clear: EU citizens are our friends, our neighbours, our
    colleagues, and we want them to stay.^1 EU citizens and their family members
    resident in the UK by 29 March 2019 will be able to stay and carry on with
    their lives broadly as now. They will continue to be able to work, study, and
    access benefits and services in the UK on the same basis after we exit the EU
    as they do now.^2
5. At the same time, the UK Government is calling on the EU and Member
    States to uphold their commitments to citizens and to protect the rights of UK
    nationals in the event of a ‘no deal’ scenario. The UK cannot act unilaterally to

```
protect the rights of UK nationals in the EU, but will take necessary steps
where possible to support UK nationals. The UK will continue to provide
updates to UK nationals in the EU on gov.uk and through its network of
Embassies, Consulates and High Commissions.
```
6. This policy paper sets out the details of our offer to EU citizens and calls upon
    the EU and Member States to take the same steps to reassure UK nationals
    in the EU that they can stay and have their rights protected, in the country
    where they have chosen to make their lives. This paper also sets out the
    support and assistance that the UK Government will make available to UK
    nationals in the EU in a ‘no deal’ scenario. This is without prejudice to the
    rights and privileges available to Irish citizens in the UK and UK nationals in
    Ireland under the Common Travel Area arrangements.
**EU citizens in the UK in a ‘no deal’ scenario**
7. We have always been clear that we highly value the contributions EU citizens
make to the social, economic and cultural fabric of the UK and that we want
them to stay in the UK. To remove any ambiguity, the UK Government
guarantees that EU citizens resident in the UK by 29 March 2019 will be able
to stay and we will take the necessary steps to protect their rights even in a
unlikely ‘no deal’ scenario.
8. To achieve this, the UK will continue to run the EU Settlement Scheme for
those resident in the UK by 29 March 2019 in a ‘no deal’ scenario. The basis
for qualifying for status under the scheme will remain the same as proposed in
a ‘deal’ scenario and will be focused on residence in the UK. This means that
any EU citizen living in the UK by 29 March 2019 will be eligible to apply to
this scheme, securing their status in UK law.
9. The application system will continue to be streamlined and user-friendly, and
will continue to draw on existing government data, to minimise the burden on
applicants to provide evidence of their residence. Throughout, the Home
Office will be looking to grant status, not for reasons to refuse. Those here by
29 March 2019 will have until 31 December 2020 to apply for status under the
scheme. Until this time, EU citizens will continue to be able to rely on their
passport (as a British citizen may) or national identity card if they are asked to
evidence their right to reside in the UK when, for example, applying for a job,
as they do currently.
10. The UK will continue to honour the right of those who obtain settled status
under the scheme to be able to leave the country for up to five consecutive


```
years without losing their right to return. We are making the commitment that,
once granted, status under the scheme is secure. More information on the EU
Settlement Scheme can be found by following the links under the ‘further
information’ section of this paper.
```
11. However, in a ‘no deal’ scenario there would be some necessary changes:
    ● As there would be no agreed implementation period, this guarantee would
       only apply to EU citizens who are resident in the UK by 29 March 2019.
    ● As there would be no agreed implementation period, those EU citizens and
       their family members resident here by 29 March 2019 would have until 31
       December 2020 to apply for a status under the EU Settlement Scheme,
       but with no six-month ‘grace period’ beyond this. The new UK immigration
       system would be implemented from 1 January 2021 as planned.
    ● EU citizens would have the right to challenge a refusal of UK immigration
       status under the EU Settlement Scheme by way of administrative review
       and judicial review, in line with the remedies generally available to
       non-EEA nationals refused leave to remain in the UK. There would be no
       preliminary reference procedure to the Court of Justice of the European
       Union, as it would not have any jurisdiction in the UK.
    ● The EU deportation threshold would continue to apply to crimes committed
       before exit. However, we would apply the UK deportation threshold to
       crimes committed after 29 March 2019.
12. EU citizens with settled status would be able to be joined in the UK, by 29
    March 2022, by existing close family members, such as children, spouses and
    partners, parents and grandparents living overseas at exit, where the
    relationship existed by 29 March 2019 (or where a child was born overseas
    after this date) and continued to exist when the family member applied. After
    29 March 2022, such family members will be able to join EU citizens here by
    applying through the applicable UK Immigration Rules. EU citizens with
    settled status will be able to be joined by future spouses and partners (where
    the relationship was established after exit) and other dependent relatives until
    31 December 2020, after which point the UK Immigration Rules would apply
    to such family reunion. Together this would bring the rights of EU citizens in
    line with the rights of UK nationals from 30 March 2022.
13. EU identity cards would remain valid for travel to the UK initially. Although
    there would be no immediate change, as we introduce the new UK


```
immigration system from 1 January 2021, we would no longer guarantee that
EU citizens will be able to use a national identity card to enter the UK. This
would support the Home Office’s attempts to streamline border processes and
better secure our borders.
```
14. We will also protect the rights of EU citizens who currently live in another state
    but travel regularly to and from the UK because they are employed or
    self-employed here, known as ‘frontier workers’. Many of this cohort will spend
    enough time in the UK to qualify for status under the EU Settlement Scheme.
    Otherwise, they will be able to obtain a separate UK immigration status which
    will allow them to continue frontier working into the UK after exit.
**In-country access to benefits and services**
15. In a ‘no deal’ scenario, EU citizens and their family members lawfully residing
in the UK by 29 March 2019 will be able to continue to access in country
benefits and services on broadly the same terms as now. This means that
they will retain their entitlement to healthcare, education, benefits and social
housing, including supported housing and homelessness assistance, on the
same basis as now. These entitlements will be subject to any future domestic
policy changes which apply to UK nationals. EU citizens will also continue to
have their professional qualifications recognised in the UK post-exit, where
they have applied for or received a recognition decision by 29 March 2019.^3
16. The specific entitlements may vary across the UK where policy
implementation is devolved. EU citizens resident in Scotland, Wales or
Northern Ireland should consult the devolved governments of those nations
where relevant.
**UK nationals in the EU in a ‘no deal scenario**
17. The Government has engaged extensively with UK nationals in the EU over
the last two years and we understand the uncertainty that would be faced by
UK nationals in the event of a ‘no deal’ scenario. We have always acted to
ensure that UK nationals can continue to live their lives broadly as they do
now, and that remains our objective in a ‘deal’ and ‘no deal’ scenario.
However the UK cannot act unilaterally to protect the rights of UK nationals in
the EU and that is why we have always prioritised reaching a reciprocal
agreement with the EU. ​The Withdrawal Agreement is the only way the UK

(^3) ​Further detail on the no deal policy for the recognition of professional qualifications can be found in the technical
notice titled ​ _Providing services including those of a qualified professional if there’s no Brexit deal._


```
Government can guarantee the rights of the one million UK nationals living in
the EU.
```
18. The UK continues to call on the EU and Member States to uphold their
    commitments to citizens and to protect the rights of UK nationals in the EU in
    the event of a ‘no deal’ scenario. We want UK nationals to be able to stay in
    the Member States that they live in when we leave, and for their rights to
    employment, healthcare, education, benefits and services to be protected. We
    ask Member States to set out details of how they would do so as soon as
    possible.
19. UK nationals who went to the EU and EU citizens who came to the UK before
    the UK’s exit from the EU did so on the basis that they would be able to settle
    permanently and build a life here, or in the EU. That is why the UK has taken
    steps to remove any ambiguity and provide complete reassurance for EU
    citizens in the UK. We ask that the EU and Member States do the same for
    our nationals.
20. We will continue to push the EU and Member States to secure these rights as
    soon as possible, which are in the mutual interest of all our citizens. Where it
    is in our control, the UK will also continue to preserve certain rights of UK
    nationals in the EU, for example by continuing to pay an uprated UK state
    pension to eligible UK nationals living in the EU.^4
21. If, however, UK nationals were unable to continue to live their lives as they do
    now in a ‘no deal’ scenario and returned to the UK to live, there are a number
    of steps the Government would consider to address concerns that have been
    raised.
22. We understand that access to healthcare is vital and can confirm that UK
    nationals who returned to the UK permanently in a ‘no deal’ scenario would
    have access to NHS-funded healthcare on the same basis as UK nationals
    already living here. They would also be able to register to vote in local and
    national elections.
23. We understand the right to bring EU and non-EU citizen family members is an
    important concern. The Government is considering the support that could be
    offered and will set out further details in due course.

(^4) subject to reciprocity.


24. We recognise that an issue raised by UK nationals is their ability to access to
    benefits and housing quickly on return to the UK. Arrangements will be made
    to ensure continuity of payments for those who return and are already in
    receipt of UK state pension or other UK benefits while living in the EU. We are
    considering how support could be offered to returning UK nationals where
    new claims are made and will set out further details in due course. UK
    nationals will continue to be able to access education in the UK and details on
    where to find information on how to apply and any current eligibility criteria are
    provided below.
25. Regarding the rights of UK nationals and access to services in the EU, the UK
    will continue to provide information on its gov.uk websites and through its
    network of Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates. We recommend
    that UK nationals monitor the ​UK nationals in the EU page​, ​Living in Guides
    and ​Travel Advice on gov.uk where we will publish information on areas such
    as residency and employment rights, and access to healthcare, benefits and
    services for UK nationals in individual Member States, as it becomes
    available. Our Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates across the EU
    will also continue to hold outreach events for UK nationals in the EU, and
    provide information via their social media channels. For information on when
    the next event in your country is, please contact your nearest British embassy,
    Consulate or High Commission.
26. We will update our ​Living in Guides with the most up to date information
    including specific actions that UK nationals may need to take in order to
    secure their rights and access to services in the EU and EFTA states.
27. Our consular network will continue to provide professional, tailored assistance
    to vulnerable UK nationals overseas.
**Reciprocal arrangements in case of a ‘no deal’ scenario**
28. Aspects of the reciprocal healthcare and social security coordination section
of the Withdrawal Agreement require reciprocity from the EU or individual
Member States and cannot be protected unilaterally. We are exploring options
to protect past social security contributions, made in the EU and the UK, and
reciprocal healthcare arrangements in the unlikely event of a 'no deal'
scenario. We are in the early stages of discussions and will announce further
details of such options prior to our exit to allow citizens to make appropriate
arrangements.


29. We are already ensuring our legal system is able to deliver these. For
    instance, the Healthcare (International Arrangements) Bill was laid in
    Parliament on 26 October 2018. This Bill will establish the legal basis to fund
    and implement reciprocal healthcare schemes after we leave the EU, whether
    through an agreement with the EU, or agreements with individual Member
    States.
30. The UK will continue to pursue reciprocal agreements with Member States to
    secure the right to stand and vote in local elections for UK nationals in the EU,
    as it is doing in a ‘deal’ scenario.
31. In show of good faith, as we pursue these bilateral agreements, we can
    confirm that EU citizens in the UK will continue to be able to vote and stand in
    England and Northern Ireland’s May 2019 local elections. The Scottish
    Parliament and Welsh Assembly are responsible for their own franchises. ​We
    can also confirm that in a ‘deal’ or ‘no deal’ scenario, any EU citizen elected to
    local government in these elections will be able to serve their full term.
**EFTA nationals in the UK and UK nationals in EFTA states**
32. The UK is seeking citizens’ rights agreements with the EFTA states (Iceland,
Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) to protect the rights of citizens. In the
event of ‘no deal’ with the EU, the UK would still pursue agreements with the
EFTA states to ensure that EFTA nationals and their dependants resident in
the UK and UK nationals and their dependants living or working in one of the
EFTA states by 29 March 2019 will be able to carry on with their lives broadly
as now. In any scenario EFTA nationals will be able to stay in the UK
post-exit. The Prime Minister discussed this with her EEA EFTA counterparts
at the Northern Future Forum in Oslo recently and they have all confirmed
that UK nationals living in those states will be able to stay.
33. UK nationals in EFTA states should consult the ​UK nationals in the EU page
and the relevant ​Living in Guide to access the most up to date information on
their rights.
